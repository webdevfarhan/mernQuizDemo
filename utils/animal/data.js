    description:
      "You are 60% Wolf and 40% Snail, what an unusual mix. As a pack animal, a wolf is incredibly proud when it comes to its families and friends, and, just lik eyou, it won't think twice before attacking something it thinks might be a threat. But, at the same time, if you know that you are definitely in the wrong, you become the snail - you recoil back into your shell and hope that the storm passes. You know that there's no point in fighting something that you know you are going to lose."

    title: '70% Elephant, 30% Cat',
    description:
      "Elephants are very intelligent animals, who have a lot of strength, but also a great deal of patience. It's normally takes something pretty extraordinary to get them angry, but when you do, you had better look out - there's nothing that can stop a charging elephant. Normally, you tend to follow the elephant when it comes to getting angry but there are a couple of exceptions. You don't really mind if people insult you, you just brush them off, but when they say something about your friends or family, you become a wild cat: incredible scrappy and withs ome pretty dangerous claws"

    description:
      "You're just a little goldfish, you like just going round in circles. No matter what might happen, you know that as long as you keep swimming, it'll sort itself out eventually. Having said this though, there are moments every now and then that catch you complete off guard. And when this happend, you're more than happy to confront them head-on, like a shark. They'll have to be pretty quick to escape you !"

    title: '70% Lion, 30% Rabbit',
    description:
      "Whenever you get upset or angry. You can't help but react like a lion- with your claws and your teeth. The most important thing is that everyone hears you. Of course, you want to prove that your opponent is completely wrong, but you also want to make sure that everyone knows about it. After all, you're a very proud person and you don't take too kindly to other people overstepping the mark, When it;s not personal though, you're like a little fluffy bunny rabbit-you make them feel guilty for even thinking you might have been wrong."
